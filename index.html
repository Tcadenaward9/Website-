  <p>I’m running to serve all residents of Ward 9, and the city. A long-time resident of Corvallis, I have a lot of experience in business, higher education, and the nonprofit sector. I am not beholden to any political party or organization, and the position of City Councilor is a nonpartisan one. 
    I want to help the city make decisions that are:</p>
    <p><ul>
      <li>Financially responsible</li>
      <li>Sustainable: informed, widely supported, long-lasting</li>
      <li>Achieving measurable results</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

<p><h3>A little bit about me...</h3></p>
<p>I grew up in San Jose, CA, the 3rd of 4 children. As the son of immigrant parents who valued education but had very little, I was the first in my family to graduate from college. I honor my roots in my drive to learn, improve, excel, serve, and inspire the next generation. Moving to Corvallis in 1995 and raising two daughters who attended Corvallis Public Schools, I have strong ties to our community.</p>
<p>My interests range widely: reading, visiting with family and friends, hiking, sports, current events, travel, and exploring what retirement means as both my wife and I are now fully retired!</p>
<p><h3>What do I stand for?</h3></p>
<p><ul>
  <li>Listening to and representing all. I will represent Ward 9 and the city. I will represent those who vote for me and those who don’t.</li>
  <li>No agenda. I am not a 1 issue candidate. All the issues facing Corvallis need to be addressed.</li>
  <li>Listening and engaging. Hearing, talking with, and keeping residents informed are central to trust in local leaders.</li>
  <li>Exploring creative solutions. Solutions that work for all of us are long-lasting if they have broad support and leverage the resources of our community.</li>
  <li>Thoughtful decision-making. Deep consideration and study are essential to making thoughtful decisions that are fiscally responsible, sustainable, and clear about attainable outcomes.</li>
  <li>Working collaboratively, pragmatically, and always learning.</li>
</ul></p> 
<p><h3>What will I work to accomplish?</h3></p>
<p>Using my diverse experience and what I have learned in my first term, I want to drive progress on critical strategic directions facing Corvallis:</p>
<p><ul>
  <li>Ensure long-term economic vitality and sustainability. This includes balanced, planned-for growth in housing and industrial land.</li>
  <li>Increase attainable housing for those who work, live, or do business in Corvallis.</li>
  <li>Ensure a safe community including clear pathways of support for vulnerable populations and resiliance in the face of climate change and in emergency preparedness.</li>
  <li>Pursue excellence in governance. Continuously improving the effectiveness and efficiency in delivering what the community needs, wants, and is willing to pay for. Improve working relationships and community engagement, communication, and trust.</li>
  <li>Provide reliable infrastructure and services. Plan for funding needed long-term capital investments.</li>
  <li>Address key livability issues such as parking, responsible development, and safety to strengthen Corvallis’s appeal as a place to live.</li>
</ul></p>
